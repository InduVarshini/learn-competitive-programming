Recipe for Solving Dynamic Programming Questions using Memoization
1. Make it work - Brute Force Recursive Solution that works!
    1. Visualize the problem as a tree - This enables us to identify the sub-problems
    2. Implement the tree using recursion
    3. Test it

2. Make it efficient
   1. Create a memo object
   2. Add a base case to return memo values
   3. Store return values into the memo

Following the above rules will make solving DP questions less intimidating
